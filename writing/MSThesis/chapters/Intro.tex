\chapter{Introduction}

\section{What is Cancer?}
Cancer is a collection of disease that is usually caused by uncontrolled division of cells and that has potential to spread to other parts of the body \cite{cancergov}. Cancer could be caused by various factors like tobacco usage, excess sun exposure, viral infection to name a few \cite{Trichopoulos}. Although, the underlying mechanism from these causes usually involves genetic mutations or epigenetic changes that alter the DNA. These alterations usually trigger a cascade of events that eventually leads to uncontrolled growth of cells \cite{Moolgavkar,Gronbaek}.

Cancer is among the highest causes of death among human beings. In the year 2021, over 600,000 deaths are expected to be caused by cancer in the US alone \cite{cancer_stats}. Cancer systems have been of research interest for several decades due to the massive impact it has on human lives. Through such research, we have been able to understand the causes and mechanism of how cancer arises and then develop new therapies and drugs that target them. Although, the mortality among some types of cancer have been reduced significantly, we were not so lucky among other types of cancers and, the overall mortality still remains pretty high.

\section{Conventional therapy against cancer}
The most popular strategies to control cancer are radiotherapy, immunotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy \cite{cancer_therapy}. Radiotherapy involves using ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells. The high intensity radiation damages the DNA beyond repair and this causes the cells to stop dividing and die. Normal cells are also affected by the ionizing radiation and hence the radiation needs to be focussed to reduce collateral damage. Surgery involves removal of the tumour by cutting open the patient. The tumour may be removed in its entirety if it is localised but partial removal may be required to relieve patients of burden when complete removal would be life threatening. Immunotherapy involves triggering the immune system of the body to fight and kill the cancer cells. Immune system on its own can detect and kill abnormal cells but cancer cells can evolve mechanisms to evade these immune suppression. Immunotherapy supplements the immune system to better target and fight against these cells. Chemotherapy involves administering drugs, usually cytotoxic to kill cancer cells. Among chemotherapy, there are different variations, hormone therapy which suppresses hormones required by some cells to survive, targeted therapy which inhibits specific enzymes or antigens produced by cancer cells, and combination therapy which uses multiple such drugs in combination. Depending on the type and stage of cancer, some of these strategies may not be effective.

Among chemotherapy, the standard clinical protocol, Standard of Care (SOC) followed for most cancer is to administer the cytotoxic drugs at the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) \cite{Frei}. The aim of this method is to kill the maximum number of tumour cells as fast as possible. This minimises the tumour burden quickly and should give better standard of living if it's the case.

However, evolutionarily thinking, a tumour would consist of cells with  heterogeneous sensitivity towards a cytotoxic drug. Under normal conditions, that is, in the absence of therapy, these cells would compete with each other and keep the number of resistant phenotype in check. On administering the drug at MTD, the most sensitive cells are killed off first and this leads to a ``competitive release" of the resistant phenotype \cite{Scott}. The resistant phenotype now grows without inhibition and takes over the population. These resistant phenotypes don't respond to further dose administered and the therapy fails. This is illustrated in \autoref{comperelease}.

Competitive release could happen for other methods of therapy as well, if there are resistant phenotypes for that particular therapy method present in the population.

\section{Adaptive therapy}
When competitive release happens, one could try to combat the cells with another drug or therapy method. However, these cells could potentially be resistant to the new drug as well and developing new drugs is research intensive. The best method would be to avoid such a competitive release in the first place. Research trend for cancer therapy has been towards development of new treatment protocols recently as a result.

Adaptive therapy (AT) is one such novel technique under development to avoid competitive release. In AT, the cytotoxic drug is administered at lower and fluctuating doses. This doesn't kill off all the sensitive cells and the probability of a competitive release is minimised. The resistant cells cannot take over due to competitive pressure from the still remaining sensitive cells and the tumour burden is maintained under control due to further doses being able to kill the sensitive cells that grow back. This is illustrated in \autoref{at}.

The dose administered at a given point is usually related to the tumour size at that given point \cite{Gatenby}. The challenge with designing AT regimens is to balance between the inhibition of resistant phenotype and the inhibition of the overall tumour size.

Even with this, AT may not be able to achieve control indefinitely. It'll only attempt to maximise the survival time compared to other regimens. AT, however, ignores the possibility of a cure, where the standard of care method would yield the best results. The patient has to live with the tumour for the rest of their life and other complications could arise due to this.
(put in discussion maybe?)

\section{Importance of competition in adaptive therapy}
The only way of controlling the resistant phenotype for a fixed drug in AT is through competition by the sensitive cells. Therefore, the success of AT in containing the tumour depends on the effectiveness of competition between sensitive and resistant cells. Although, previously it was thought that resistant cells are required to have an inherent disadvantage for AT to be successful, even without it the survival time can be prolonged by competition between the cells \cite{Strobl}.

Cells can use different strategies such as higher proliferation rate, better survival at suboptimal conditions or lower death rate to compete with each other, and several such strategies are seen to be acquired over the course of cancer progression, as shown by the ``hallmarks of cancer" framework \cite{Hanahan}.

\section{System of Study}
The metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) was chosen to be the system of study. The mCRPC system already has a history of AT work done on it, although in different contexts \cite{Cunningham,Zhang}.

Prostate cells express androgen receptors (ARs) that require testosterone or its metabolite, 5$\alpha$-dihydrotestosterone to activate. Activated ARs bind to promoters of genes responsible for proliferation \cite{Heinlein}. Without testosterone, proliferation is halted and the cells die of apoptosis. When cancerous cells evolve from prostate cells, the AR mechanism is preserved and such prostate cancer remains testosterone dependent.

This system is usually modelled as consisting of three different types of cells: $T^+$, $T^p$ and $T^-$. $T^+$ is the baseline population for prostate cancer which require testosterone for survival. The standard therapy for prostate cancer is castration or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) which blocks external production of testosterone and would kill the $T^+$ cells in a normal castration sensitive prostate cancer. However, castration resistant prostate cancer soon develops, as the $T^p$ cells can produce testosterone and sustain the $T^+$ cells. $T^p$ cells are also dependent on testosterone, and they produce testosterone from cholesterol through upregulation of CYP17$\alpha$ \cite{Dillard}. The $T^-$ cells on the other hand do not require testosterone as they have mutated ARs that remain active even in the absence of testosterone.

Abiraterone is a drug developed against mCRPC that inhibits the CYP17$\alpha$ and can be effective against both $T^+$ and $T^p$, however, not against $T^-$. And, this could lead to competitive release of the resistant $T^-$ cells if administered in the standard clinical protocol. Abiraterone is usually administered after ADT as the system develops into a mCRPC. For our study, we shall only consider AT protocols on abiraterone under ADT.

\section{Goal of the Project}
The goal of the project is to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Develop a model of the chosen system of study with their respective resource dependence.
  \item Study the dynamics of the system under different conditions in the absence of therapy.
  \item Compare the dynamics under effect of different therapy regimens.
  \item Find the corresponding optimal therapy regimen that maximises the survival time for particular conditions.
\end{enumerate}
