\section{Pairwise $T^p$ - $T^-$}
From the initial runs where two parameters were changed at a time, the following were observed:
\begin{enumerate}
  %\item $T^p$ is limited by both testosterone and oxygen, whereas $T^-$ is only limited by oxygen. The testosterone limitation is controlled through the two thresholds, $ll_{test,T^p}$ and $ul_{test,T^p}$ as shown in \autoref{freseq}.
  \item Only when $T^p$ is not severely testosterone limited ($ul_{test,T^p}$ is low), $T^p$ can coexist with or outcompete $T^-$ as shown in \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_testlims}. In every other case, $T^-$ drives $T^p$ to extinction.
  \item These competitive outcomes are also dependent on the initial proportion of $T^p$, all the other parameters being the same as shown in  \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_testlims}.
  \item  When $T^-$ is strongly oxygen-limited ($ll_{O_2,T^-} \geq 0.6$) but $T^p$ is also limited by testosterone. In this case, $T^-$ wins out eventually as oxygen levels rise faster than testosterone through the external supply term, $p_{O_2}$ as shown in \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_o2lims}.
  \item When $T^-$ is oxygen limited but with poor oxygen production (lower $p_{O_2}$), $T^p$ is able to drive $T^-$ to extinction as $T^p$ can grow and consume enough oxygen to keep the oxygen levels below those required for $T^-$ to grow as shown in \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_o2lims}.
\end{enumerate}

The normal and poor production of oxygen are 0.11 and 0.0675 min$^{-1}$ respectively}

Additionally, a brute force parameter space exploration was done over a large combination of parameters. Due to the large parameter set, interpreting the results is difficult and only a few generalised observations were found, as listed below.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $T^-$ drives $T^p$ to extinction when $ll_{O_2,T^p} \geq 0.6$, regardless of the other parameters, in other words, $T^p$ shouldn't be limited by oxygen to compete with $T^-$. This is visualised in \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_llo2Tp}.
  \item $T^-$ drives $T^p$ to extinction when $ll_{test,T^p} \geq 0.2$, regardless of the other parameters, in other words, $T^p$ needs to be able to grow even on the smallest amount of testosterone to compete with $T^-$. This is visualised in \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_lltestTp}.
  \item $T^-$ drives $T^p$ to extinction when $ul_{test,T^p} \geq 0.3$ and $ll_{O_2,T^-} \leq 0.4$ but not when $ll_{O_2,T^-} \geq 0.6$, in other words, $T^p$ shouldn't be testosterone limited when $T^-$ is not oxygen limited to be to compete with $T^-$. The $ul_{test,T^p}$ required for $T^p$ to not go extinct also increases with increased $ll_{O_2,T^-}$, that is, $T^p$ can afford to be more testosterone limited as $T^-$ becomes more oxygen limited. This is visualised in \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_ultestTp}.

From the above observations, the following cases were formulated as an exhaustive formulation of possible conditions. Three levels of testosterone limitation of $T^p$
pairwise competitive runs were done over varying initial cell seeding.

\newpage
The following were observed from the cases as visualised in \autoref{fig_Tpro-Tneg_cases}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Coexistence is observed only in cases AAA, AAB, BAA and BAB. All of them have low or moderate limitation of testosterone for $T^p$ and have no limitation of oxygen for $T^-$. For low $T^p$ initial seeding, $T^-$ dominates over $T^p$ and causes it to go extinct, but as $T^p$ initial seeding increases the favour shift towards $T^p$.
  \item $T^-$ causes $T^p$ to go extinct for all initial seedings in cases AAC, ABC, BAC and BBC. $T^p$ is severely testosterone limited and even with a high initial seeding advantage, $T^-$ grows, overtakes $T^p$ and eventually causes $T^p$ to go extinct. At high $T^p$ initial seeding, $T^-$ also goes extinct in case BBC due to high oxygen limitation on it.
  \item The outcome switches from $T^p$ going extinct to $T^-$ going extinct for higher $T^p$ initial seeding in cases ABA, ABB, ACA, ACB, ACC, BBA and BBB. As with cases AAA, AAB, BAA and BAB, for low $T^p$ initial seeding, $T^-$ dominates over $T^p$ and causes it to go extinct, but as $T^p$ initial seeding increases the favour shift towards $T^p$. However, in this case the oxygen levels don't go above the levels required for $T^-$ to grow before it goes extinct and only $T^p$ remains. Case ACC has this switch only at the highest $T^p$ initial seeding as it is also severely testosterone limited.
  \item $T^-$ goes extinct for all initial seedings in cases BCA, BCB and BCC. $T^p$ also goes extinct in the case BCC. The oxygen limitation on $T^-$ is too high and the oxygen levels never reach the levels required for a non-zero growth for $T^-$. In the case BCC, $T^p$ is weighed down by both the testosterone limitation and density-dependent competition of the remaining $T^-$ cells and goes extinct as a result.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Pairwise $T^+$ - $T^p$}
From the initial runs where two parameters were changed at a time, the following were observed:
\begin{enumerate}
    %\item Both $T^+$ and $T^p$ are limited by both oxygen and testosterone, and compete for both resources. As with the other pair, strength of limitation for any particular resource can be modulated through the corresponding upper and lower thresholds.
    \item When $T^p$ limited by testosterone more than $T^+$ ($ul_{test,Tp} > ul_{test,T+}$), $T^+$ can consume and grow on the limited testosterone present, and this is enough for the density-dependent competition to drive $T^p$ to extinction. Without $T^p$ to provide testosterone, $T^+$ subsequently goes extinct.
    \item When $T^p$ is weakly limited by testosterone relative to $T^+$ ($ul_{test,Tp} \leq ul_{test,T+}$), both cells coexist. Due to weaker testosterone limitation, $T^p$ can grow faster initially and secrete enough testosterone for $T^+$ without being negatively affected by $T^+$. This is visualised in \autoref{fig_Tpos-Tpro_testlims}.
    \item In the above case, the proportion of $T^+$ in the final population decreases as $T^+$ becomes more testosterone limited.
    \item When both are severely testosterone limited but not oxygen limited, $T^p$ causes $T^+$ to go extinct. However, in a special scenario when both are oxygen limited with $T^+$ being more limited, coexistence is observed. A balance of sort is achieved here, where, in the initial period of low oxygen, $T^p$ can grow more than $T^+$ and secrete enough testosterone to sustain both population but doesn't grow as much as to drive $T^+$ to extinction. This is visualised in \autoref{fig_Tpos-Tpro_o2lims}.
  \end{enumerate}

From the above observations, the following cases were formulated as representative and pairwise competitive runs were done over varying initial cell seeding.

Here,
\begin{itemize}
  \item For $T^+/T^p\ O_2$ limitation: no, moderate and severe correspond to $ll_{O_2,T^i}=0, 0.4, 0.8$ respectively.
  \item For $T^+/T^p\ test$ limitation: no, moderate and severe correspond to $ul_{test,T^i}=0.1, 0.3, 1$ respectively.
\end{itemize}

The following were observed from the different cases. For better visualization, the figures are divided into testosterone limitations in \autoref{fig_Tpos-Tpro_cases_test}, oxygen limitations in \autoref{fig_Tpos-Tpro_cases_o2} and combinations of the limitiations in \autoref{fig_Tpos-Tpro_cases_combi}.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $T^p$ causes $T^+$ to go extinct for all initial seedings in cases CAAA and CBAA. $T^+$ is severely oxygen limited and $T^p$ quickly utilized the intial period to grow to a large population and suppress $T^+$ from further growth.
  \item A similar situation to above happens for cases AACA and AACB, but for high initial seeding of $T^p$, a very small population of $T^+$ is able to survive due to the excess testosterone produced by $T^p$.
  \item Both the cell types go extinct for cases AAAC and AABC. $T^p$ is severly limited by testosterone and $T^+$ consumes the limited amount produced by $T^p$ and denies it of growth. $T^p$ goes exctinct and soon followed by $T^+$ due to non availability of testosterone.
  \item A similar behaviour to above happens for cases ACAA and BCAA, but for high initial seeding of $T^p$ with low total population, there is coexistence. Both the cells manage to survive until the oxygen levels reach above the levels required for growth and they can recover from it. For higher total populations, the density-dependent suppression is too high and they go extinct before oxygen levels can reach it.
  \item In case AACC, at low initial $T^p$ seeding, it follows a similar behaviour to cases AAAC and AABC and both go extinct while at high initial $T^p$ seeding, it follows a similar behaviour to cases AACA and AACB, where there is extinction of $T^+$ at medium $T^p$ seeding and coexistence at high $T^p$ seeding.
  \item Both coexist for all initial seeding in cases AAAA and AABA. Here, $T^p$ can grow unhindered by $T^+$, secrete testosterone, which $T^+$ can grow on. Case AABB is similar, but both go extinct at low initial seeding as $T^+$ dominates over $T^p$ through number and prevents it from growing due to the higher testosterone limitation.
  \item Case AAAB is the opposite of the above as only at high $T^p$ initial seeding can both coexist. $T^+$ can grow better than $T^p$ for the same amount of testosterone present and can outnumber and cause $T^p$ to go extinct. At higher $T^p$ seeding, $T^p$ has a numbers advantage from the begining and can produce enough testosterone to sustain both.
  \item Case BBAA is exactly the same as Case AAAA as both are limtied by the same amount.
  \item $T^+$ is driven to extinction in all but the low initial $T^p$ seeding in Case BAAA. At low $T^p$ seeding, $T^+$ can use the number advantage to stay alive and then use the testosterone produced by $T^p$ to grow but at higher seedings, $T^+$ is limited by oxygen.
  \item In case ABAA, at low initial $T^p$ seeding, the higher $T^+$ number can cause $T^p$ to go extinct and eventually both the cell types. Whereas at higher initial $T^p$ seeding, despite $T^+$ growing faster than $T^p$ due to lowered oxygen limitation, stops at a point due to requirement of testosterone produced by $T^p$ and this maintains a balance between the two cells.
  \item Cases BBAA, BBAB, BBBA and BBBB were exactly the same as cases AAAA, AAAB, AABA and AABB respectively as the two corresponding cases are limtied by oxygen by the same amount with all else being the same.
  \item In a similar manner cases ABBB and BABB are similar to cases ABAA and BAAA. Due to the higher testosterone limitations of $T^p$, a higher $T^p$ initial seeding is required have $T^p$ overcome suppression by $T^+$. Additionally in case ABBB, the higher testosterone limitation of $T^+$ leads to higher $T^p$ required for testosterone and a higher final $T^p$ population.
  \item Case ABAB gives a double disadvantage to $T^p$ due to both testosterone and oxygen limitiation and it goes extinct along with $T^+$ in all seedings. Similarly, case BABA gives a double disadvantage to $T^+$ and $T^+$ goes extinct for all seedings.
  \item Case ABBA is similar to case ABBB, but can coexist at lower initial seeding as well since $T^p$ is not testosterone limited.
  \item At low initial $T^p$ seeding, both cells go extinct due to higher testosterone limitation of $T^p$. However at higher initial $T^p$ seeding, $T^p$ is able to push $T^+$ to extinction due to the higher oxygen limitation of $T^+$.

\section{All 3 celltypes}
\subsection{Efficiency}
To simplify things, the resource limitations as described in the previous sections can instead be considered as efficiencies of the cell types in utilization of a particular resource.
Although many possible combinations are there, all the cell types are assumed to have the same efficiencies for the respective resources.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item When the testosterone efficiency is high, all the three cell types can coexist in all the oxygen efficiency cases as shown in \autoref{fig_all3_o2eff}.
  \item At lower oxygen efficiency, $T^-$ is able to have a larger final population as the turn over is slower in the case of $T^-$.
  \item The difference between null oxygen efficiency and high oxygen efficiency is small, where high oxygen efficiency has a slightly higher $T^+$ and $T^p$ and a lower $T^-$ final population.
  \item The same holds when the initial seeding is at $8:1:1\ T^p:T^+:T^-$ ratio but the final population of $T^p$ is much higher in this case.
  \item At null oxygen efficiency, all three cell types can coexist in all the testosterone efficiency cases only when the initial seeding is at $8:1:1\ T^p:T^+:T^-$ ratio as shown in \autoref{fig_all3_testeff}.
  \item At lower testosterone efficiency, $T^-$ is able to have a larger final population due to no effect of the efficiency changes on $T^-$.
