abstract = "In metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), abiraterone is conventionally administered continuously at maximal tolerated dose until treatment failure. The majority of patients initially respond well to abiraterone but the cancer cells evolve resistance and the cancer progresses within a median time of 16 months. Incorporating techniques that attempt to delay or prevent the growth of the resistant cancer cell phenotype responsible for disease progression have only recently entered the clinical setting. Here we use evolutionary game theory to model the evolutionary dynamics of patients with mCRPC subject to abiraterone therapy. In evaluating therapy options, we adopt an optimal control theory approach and seek the best treatment schedule using nonlinear constrained optimization. We compare patient outcomes from standard clinical treatments to those with other treatment objectives, such as maintaining a constant total tumor volume or minimizing the fraction of resistant cancer cells within the tumor. Our model predicts that continuous high doses of abiraterone as well as other therapies aimed at curing the patient result in accelerated competitive release of the resistant phenotype and rapid subsequent tumor progression. We find that long term control is achievable using optimized therapy through the restrained and judicious application of abiraterone, maintaining its effectiveness while providing acceptable patient quality of life. Implementing this strategy will require overcoming psychological and emotional barriers in patients and physicians as well as acquisition of a new class of clinical data designed to accurately estimate intratumoral eco-evolutionary dynamics during therapy."

	abstract = {Prostate cancer progression depends in part on the complex interactions between testosterone, its active metabolite DHT, and androgen receptors. In a metastatic setting, the first line of treatment is the elimination of testosterone. However, such interventions are not curative because cancer cells evolve via multiple mechanisms to a castrate-resistant state, allowing progression to a lethal outcome. It is hypothesized that administration of antiandrogen therapy in an intermittent, as opposed to continuous, manner may bestow improved disease control with fewer treatment-related toxicities. The present study develops a biochemically motivated mathematical model of antiandrogen therapy that can be tested prospectively as a predictive tool. The model includes {\textquotedblleft}personalized{\textquotedblright} parameters, which address the heterogeneity in the predicted course of the disease under various androgen-deprivation schedules. Model simulations are able to capture a variety of clinically observed outcomes for {\textquotedblleft}average{\textquotedblright} patient data under different intermittent schedules. The model predicts that in the absence of a competitive advantage of androgen-dependent cancer cells over castration-resistant cancer cells, intermittent scheduling can lead to more rapid treatment failure as compared to continuous treatment. However, increasing a competitive advantage for hormone-sensitive cells swings the balance in favor of intermittent scheduling, delaying the acquisition of genetic or epigenetic alterations empowering androgen resistance. Given the near universal prevalence of antiandrogen treatment failure in the absence of competing mortality, such modeling has the potential of developing into a useful tool for incorporation into clinical research trials and ultimately as a prognostic tool for individual patients.},

Expression of androgen receptor and androgen receptor{\textendash}regulated proteins suggests androgen receptor activation in recurrent prostate cancer. Many groups have pursued mechanisms of ligand-independent androgen receptor activation but we found high levels of testicular androgens in recurrent prostate cancer tissue using RIA. Experimental Designs: Prostate specimens from 36 men were procured preserving blood flow to prevent ischemia and cyropreserved immediately. Recurrent prostate cancer specimens from 18 men whose cancer recurred locally during androgen deprivation therapy and androgen-stimulated benign prostate specimens from 18 men receiving no hormonal treatments were studied. Tissue levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were measured in each specimen using liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels were compared with clinical variables and treatment received. Results: Testosterone levels were similar in recurrent prostate cancer (3.75 pmol/g tissue) and androgen-stimulated benign prostate (2.75 pmol/g tissue, Wilcoxon two-sided, P = 0.30). Dihydrotestosterone levels decreased 91\% in recurrent prostate cancer (1.25 pmol/g tissue) compared with androgen-stimulated benign prostate (13.7 pmol/g tissue; Wilcoxon two-sided, P \&lt; 0.0001) although dihydrotestosterone levels in most specimens of recurrent prostate cancer were sufficient for androgen receptor activation. Testosterone or dihydrotestosterone levels were not related to metastatic status, antiandrogen treatment, or survival (Wilcoxon rank sum, all P \&gt; 0.2). Conclusions: Recurrent prostate cancer may develop the capacity to biosynthesize testicular androgens from adrenal androgens or cholesterol. This surprising finding suggests intracrine production of dihydrotestosterone and should be exploited for novel treatment of recurrent prostate cancer.},

Leflunomide is prescribed to patients worldwide as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory disease-modifying prodrug. Leflunomide inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer xenographs in mice, and leflunomide or TFN promoted cytostasis and/or apoptosis in cultured cells. These findings suggest that TFN could be useful in prostate cancer chemoprevention. We investigated the possible mechanistic aspects of this tenet by characterizing the effects of TFN using premalignant PWR-1E and malignant DU-145 human prostate epithelial cells. TFN promoted a dose- and time-dependent cytostasis or apoptosis induction in these cells. The cytostatic effects of TFN, which were reversible but not by the presence of excess uridine in the culture medium, included diminished cellular uridine levels, an inhibition in oxygen consumption, a suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, S-phase cell cycle arrest, and a conspicuous reduction in the size and number of the nucleoli in the nuclei of these cells. Conversely, TFN's apoptogenic effects were characteristic of catastrophic mitochondrial disruption (i.e., a dissipation of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, enhanced ROS production, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and cytoplasmic vacuolization) and followed by DNA fragmentation. The respiration-deficient derivatives of the DU-145 cells, which are also uridine auxotrophs, were markedly resistant to the cytostatic and apoptotic effects of TFN, implicating de novo pyrimidine synthesis and mitochondrial bioenergetics as the primary targets for TFN in the respiration competent cells. These mechanistic findings advocate a role for TFN and mitochondrial bioenergetics in prostate cancer chemoprevention."

abstract = {Abstract Background. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute and American total mortality rates, the authors calculated the probability at birth of having a diagnosis of prostate cancer within a man's life to be 8.8\% and then subtracted the incidence of microscopic Stage A cancers too small to ever be clinically significant. This gave a final probability of 8\%. Methods. Prostates were examined after 139 consecutive unselected cystoprostatectomies from patients with bladder cancers in whom it was unknown whether they had prostate cancer. Prostate cancer was found in 55 patients (40\%); the volume of the largest cancer in each specimen was determined using histologic morphometry. The authors identified the 8\% of these 139 cystoprostatectomy specimens with the largest volume of prostate cancer. Results. The largest 11 of the 55 cancers represented 7.9\% of the total 139 samples. These cancers ranged in volume from 0.5–6.1 ml, representing only 20\% of all patients with prostate cancer. Conclusions. If the strong evidence is accepted that cancer progression is proportional to cancer volume, it was concluded that prostate cancers larger than 0.5 ml appear to correspond to the 8\% of men who will be diagnosed with a clinically significant carcinoma, as derived previously. Conversely, those 80\% of prostate cancers smaller than 0.5 ml probably are not likely to reach a clinically significant size in view of the long doubling time of this cancer.},

abstract = "It is generally accepted that the initiation and progression of cancers is the result of somatic clonal evolution. Despite many peculiarities, evolution within populations of somatic cells should obey the same Darwinian principles as evolution within natural populations, i.e. variability of heritable phenotypes provides the substrate for context-specific selection forces leading to increased population frequencies of phenotypes, which are better adapted to their environment. Yet, within cancer biology, the more prevalent way to view evolution is as being entirely driven by the accumulation of “driver” mutations. Context-specific selection forces are either ignored, or viewed as constraints from which tumor cells liberate themselves during the course of malignant progression. In this review, we will argue that explicitly focusing on selection forces acting on the populations of neoplastic cells as the driving force of somatic clonal evolution might provide for a more accurate conceptual framework compared to the mutation-centric driver gene paradigm. Whereas little can be done to counteract the “bad luck” of stochastic occurrences of cancer-related mutations, changes in selective pressures and the phenotypic adaptations they induce can, in principle, be exploited to limit the incidence of cancers and to increase the efficiency of existing and future therapies.

	abstract = {Evolutionary theory suggests that the emergence of resistance to cancer therapy may be prevented or delayed by exploiting competitive ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and resistant tumor cell subpopulations. Recent studies have shown that a strategy aiming for containment, not elimination, can control tumor burden more effectively than more aggressive conventional therapy in vitro, in mouse models, and in the clinic. However, although various mathematical and computational models have been proposed to explain the superiority of particular containment strategies (such as adaptive therapy), this evolutionary approach to cancer therapy lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation. Here we combine mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to establish general conditions under which a containment strategy is expected to control tumor burden more effectively than applying the maximum tolerated dose. We show that when resistant cells are present, an idealized strategy of containing a tumor at a maximum tolerable size maximizes time to treatment failure (that is, the time at which tumor burden becomes intolerable). These results are very general and do not depend on any fitness cost of resistance. We provide formulas for predicting the clinical benefits attributable to containment strategies in a wide range of scenarios, and we compare outcomes of theoretically optimal treatments with those of more practical protocols. Our results strengthen the rationale for clinical trials of evolutionarily-informed cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {A number of successful systemic therapies are available for treatment of disseminated cancers. However, tumor response is often transient, and therapy frequently fails due to emergence of resistant populations. The latter reflects the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment as well as the evolutionary capacity of cancer phenotypes to adapt to therapeutic perturbations. Although cancers are highly dynamic systems, cancer therapy is typically administered according to a fixed, linear protocol. Here we examine an adaptive therapeutic approach that evolves in response to the temporal and spatial variability of tumor microenvironment and cellular phenotype as well as therapy-induced perturbations. Initial mathematical models find that when resistant phenotypes arise in the untreated tumor, they are typically present in small numbers because they are less fit than the sensitive population. This reflects the {\textquotedblleft}cost{\textquotedblright} of phenotypic resistance such as additional substrate and energy used to up-regulate xenobiotic metabolism, and therefore not available for proliferation, or the growth inhibitory nature of environments (i.e., ischemia or hypoxia) that confer resistance on phenotypically sensitive cells. Thus, in the Darwinian environment of a cancer, the fitter chemosensitive cells will ordinarily proliferate at the expense of the less fit chemoresistant cells. The models show that, if resistant populations are present before administration of therapy, treatments designed to kill maximum numbers of cancer cells remove this inhibitory effect and actually promote more rapid growth of the resistant populations. We present an alternative approach in which treatment is continuously modulated to achieve a fixed tumor population. The goal of adaptive therapy is to enforce a stable tumor burden by permitting a significant population of chemosensitive cells to survive so that they, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit but chemoresistant subpopulations. Computer simulations show that this strategy can result in prolonged survival that is substantially greater than that of high dose density or metronomic therapies. The feasibility of adaptive therapy is supported by in vivo experiments. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4894{\textendash}903] Major Findings We present mathematical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor populations with and without therapy. Analytic solutions and numerical simulations show that, with pretreatment, therapy-resistant cancer subpopulations are present due to phenotypic or microenvironmental factors; maximum dose density chemotherapy hastens rapid expansion of resistant populations. The models predict that host survival can be maximized if {\textquotedblleft}treatment-for-cure strategy{\textquotedblright} is replaced by {\textquotedblleft}treatment-for-stability.{\textquotedblright} Specifically, the models predict that an optimal treatment strategy will modulate therapy to maintain a stable population of chemosensitive cells that can, in turn, suppress the growth of resistant populations under normal tumor conditions (i.e., when therapy-induced toxicity is absent). In vivo experiments using OVCAR xenografts treated with carboplatin show that adaptive therapy is feasible and, in this system, can produce long-term survival. {\textcopyright}2009 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {{\textquotedblleft}Control and conquer{\textquotedblright} - this is the philosophy behind adaptive therapy, which seeks to exploit intra-tumoural competition to avoid, or at least, delay the emergence of therapy resistance in cancer. Motivated by promising results from theoretical, experimental and, most recently, a clinical study in prostate cancer, there is an increasing interest in extending this approach to other cancers. As such, it is urgent to understand the characteristics of a cancer which determine whether it will respond well to adaptive therapy, or not. A plausible candidate for such a selection criterion is the fitness cost of resistance. In this paper, we study a simple competition model between sensitive \&amp; resistant cell populations to investigate whether the presence of a cost is a necessary condition for adaptive therapy to extend the time to progression beyond that of a standard-of-care continuous therapy. We find that for tumours close to their environmental carrying capacity such a cost of resistance is not required. However, for tumours growing far from carrying capacity, a cost may be required to see meaningful gains. Notably, we show that in such cases it is important to consider the cell turnover in the tumour and we discuss its role in modulating the impact of a cost of resistance. Overall, our work helps to clarify under which circumstances adaptive therapy may be beneficial, and suggests that turnover may play an unexpectedly important role in the decision making process.},

 abstract = "The effect of dose and dose rate of cancer chemotherapeutic agents in experimental in vivo systems and in various clinical situations has been reviewed. In experimental in vivo systems, the dose-response curve for most chemotherapeutic agents is steep. Although the dose response curve may be linear for cytokinetically homogeneous experimental tumors, it deviates from linearity as a result of tumor heterogeneity. The steepness of the dose-response curve is related to the sensitivity of the tumor to a given drug. Thus, for highly sensitive tumors, the curve is very steep and generally linear; whereas for relatively insensitive tumors, dose may have little effect on response. These observations in general apply to the clinic. When dose has been a randomized variable, a dose-response curve is generally evident in sensitive tumors, such as the leukemias, the lymphomas, testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer. In contrast, when the difference in dose is in the range of twofold, the evidence for superiority of the high dose in such situations as 5-fluorouracil for colorectal cancer and dimethyl-triazeno-imidazole-car☐amide (DTIC) for melanoma is less impressive. The use of relatively low dose maintenance treatment following four to six courses of intensive combination chemotherapy for such diseases as testicular cancer and lymphoma may prolong the duration of remission but probably will not increase the cure rate. In adjuvant chemotherapy situations, in which prolonged disease-free survival is improved, the dose-response curve would appear to be quite steep. Conservative dosing in this setting may compromise the cure rate, and the proposed approach is to maintain full dose therapy and consider reducing the total duration of treatment. When high doses or concentrations of antitumor therapy can be achieved, such as in the marrow transplant situation and in isolation perfusion or regional infusion studies, there is in general clear evidence that a substantial increase in response rate occurs."
